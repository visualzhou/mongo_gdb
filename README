A set of gdb pretty printers for objects in the MongoDB source code.

### Install
If you find the need to bypass the printers and look at the raw fields, use
the /r flag to print.

To use add the following lines to your .gdbinit, adjusting the path as needed:

```python
python
import sys
import os
try:
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser('~/10gen/mongo_gdb/'))
    import mongo_printer
    mongo_printer.register_mongo_printers()
    # Show mutex and MongoDB lock holders
    import mongo_lock
except Exception:
    print('Error loading mongo_printer and mongo_lock')
    pass
end

### Run mongo_lock.show_lock_holders()
```

### Print out lock holders

```
(gdb) thread apply all python mongo_lock.show_lock_holders()
